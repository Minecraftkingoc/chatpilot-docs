# Privacy Policy for ChatPilot

This Privacy Policy explains how ChatPilot handles user data when used within Discord.

## 1. No Data Storage

ChatPilot does not store any messages, user IDs, or personal information. All interactions are processed in real time and are not saved or logged.

## 2. Verba Free Instance

ChatPilot uses the official Verba Free instance provided by [verba.ink](https://verba.ink). This instance is designed for privacy and does not retain any user data. No tracking, profiling, or analytics are performed.

## 3. Discord Permissions

ChatPilot only requests the minimum permissions necessary to function:
- Reading and sending messages in selected channels
- Responding to slash commands

It does not read private messages or access server data beyond what is required for its features.

## 4. Third-Party Services

ChatPilot does not integrate with any third-party services beyond Discord and Verba. No external APIs are used to collect or transmit user data.

## 5. User Control

Server administrators can enable or disable ChatPilot in specific channels using slash commands. Users can reset their conversation context at any time using `/reset`.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated at any time. Significant changes will be announced via the official project page or support server.

## 7. Contact
